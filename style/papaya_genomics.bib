  abstract = {Papaya is a tropical and climacteric fruit that is recognized for its nutritional benefits and medicinal applications. Its fruits ripen quickly and show a drastic fruit softening, leading to great post-harvest losses. To overcome this scenario, breeding programs of papaya must invest in exploring the available genetic variation to continue developing superior cultivars with improved fruit quality traits. The objective of this study was to perform a whole-genome genotyping (WGG) of papaya, predict the effects of the identified variants, and develop a list of ripening-related genes (RRGs) with linked variants. The Formosa elite lines of papaya Sekati and JS-12 were submitted to WGG with an Illumina Miseq platform. The effects of variants were predicted using the snpEff program. A total of 28,451 SNPs having Ts/Tv (Transition/Transversion) ratio of 2.45 and 1,982 small insertions/deletions (InDels) were identified. Most variant effects were predicted in non-coding regions, with only 2,104 and 138 effects placed in exons and splice site regions, respectively. A total of 106 RRGs were found to be associated with 460 variants, which may be converted into PCR markers to facilitate genetic mapping and diversity studies and to apply marker-assisted selection (MAS) for specific traits in papaya breeding programs.},

  abstract = {A wealth of plant species used by humans for different purposes, but mainly as food, originated and domesticated in the Mesoamerican region. Papaya (Carica papaya) is the third most cultivated tropical crop worldwide, and it has been hypothesized that Mesoamerica is the most likely center of its origin and domestication. In support of it, many wild populations of papaya occur throughout Mesoamerica and hence represent the gene pool of genetic variability for further evolution and future crop management. Despite its importance, a dearth of information exists regarding the status of wild populations of papaya, as compared to the extent of knowledge, and interest, on domesticated varieties. We review the evidence on the extant wild populations of papaya, as well as its origin and distribution. Also, we synthetize what is known on the domestication history of the species, including the domestication syndrome that distinguishes wild and domesticated papayas. Moreover, we make an account of the use of genetic markers to assess genetic diversity of wild and domesticated papaya, and discuss the importance of papaya as the first species with a transgenic cultivar to be released for human consumption, and one that has its complete genome sequenced. Evidence from different disciplines strongly suggest that papaya originated and was domesticated in Mesoamerica, and that wild populations in the region possess, still, high genetic diversity compared to the domesticated papaya. Finally, we outline papaya as an excellent model species for genomic studies that will help gain insight into the domestication process and improvement of papaya and other tropical crops.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Papaya (\mkbibemph{Carica papaya} L.) is an important tropical species popular for highly nutritious fruit as well as medicinal value. In addition, non-commercial cultivation of papaya trees has resulted in dual-purpose cultivars grown for both fruit and ornamental value in residential areas. Petiole color is a key ornamental trait in papaya that varies amongst cultivars depending on anthocyanin accumulation resulting in purple or green pigmentation. Although inherited as a simple trait, genetic characterization and genomic loci responsible for the purple petiole color in papaya is unknown. In this study, F\textsubscript{1} and F\textsubscript{2} populations generated from two breeding lines PR-2043 (green petiole) and T5-2562 (purple petiole) were used to evaluate the inheritance patterns of petiole color as well as determine genetic loci and genes involved in petiole pigmentation in papaya through bulk segregant analysis (BSA) and transcriptome sequencing. The segregation of purple petiole color followed a single dominant gene inheritance model (3:1). BSA-seq analysis indicated key genes influencing petiole color are mainly located in chromosome 1 (0.01 to 5.96 Mb) of the papaya genome. Four major genes, including \mkbibemph{CHS}, \mkbibemph{MYB20}, \mkbibemph{MYB315}-like, and \mkbibemph{MYB75}-like within this region exhibited significant differential expression in a comparison between purple and green petiole papaya plants. A relatively high abundance of \mkbibemph{CHS} transcripts was observed in purple petioles and may signify a major involvement in regulating anthocyanins accumulation in papaya petioles. The findings of this study facilitate the future efforts of breeding papaya cultivars with higher economical value in residential landscapes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Papaya, a fruit crop cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, is known for its nutritional benefits and medicinal applications. Here we report a 3\texttimes{} draft genome sequence of `SunUp' papaya, the first commercial virus-resistant transgenic fruit tree to be sequenced. The papaya genome is three times the size of the Arabidopsis genome, but contains fewer genes, including significantly fewer disease-resistance gene analogues. Comparison of the five sequenced genomes suggests a minimal angiosperm gene set of 13,311. A lack of recent genome duplication, atypical of other angiosperm genomes sequenced so far--, may account for the smaller papaya gene number in most functional groups. Nonetheless, striking amplifications in gene number within particular functional groups suggest roles in the evolution of tree-like habit, deposition and remobilization of starch reserves, attraction of seed dispersal agents, and adaptation to tropical daylengths. Transgenesis at three locations is closely associated with chloroplast insertions into the nuclear genome, and with topoisomerase I recognition sites. Papaya offers numerous advantages as a system for fruit-tree functional genomics, and this draft genome sequence provides the foundation for revealing the basis of Carica's distinguishing morpho-physiological, medicinal and nutritional properties.},

These characters justify papaya genomics programs. Recently, a draft of the papaya genome has been sequenced, and the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) and its corresponding region of the X chromosome have been fully sequenced. Sequencing the papaya genome and the MSY will enhance our capacity to explore the origin and evolution of dioecy in the family of Caricaceae, expand our knowledge on genome evolution by serving as an outgroup for the intensively studied family Brassicaceae, identify candidate genes for target traits, and provide genome-wide DNA markers for papaya improvement.},

  abstract = {Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is an important tropical and subtropical fruit crop, and understanding its genome is essential for breeding. In this study, we assembled a high-quality genome of 344.17~Mb for the newly cultivated papaya 'Zihui', which contains 22\,250 protein-coding genes. By integrating 201 resequenced papaya genomes, we identified four distinct papaya groups and a 34~Mb genomic region with strong domestication selection signals. Within these regions, two key genes associated with papaya yield were discovered: Cp\_zihui06549, encoding a leucine-rich receptor-like protein kinase, and Cp\_zihui06768, encoding the accumulation of photosystem one 1 (APO1) protein. Heterologous expression of Cp\_zihui06549 in tomato confirmed that the total number of fruits in transgenic lines more than doubled compared to wild-type plants, resulting in a significant yield increase. Furthermore, we constructed a pan-genome of papaya and obtained a 77.41~Mb nonreference sequence containing 1543 genes. Within this pan-genome, 2483 variable genes, we detected, including four genes annotated as the 'terpene synthase activity' Gene Ontology term, which were lost in cultivars during domestication. Finally, gene retention analyses were performed using gene presence and absence variation data and differentially expressed genes across various tissues and organs. This study provides valuable insights into the genes and loci associated with phenotypes and domestication processes, laying a solid foundation for future papaya breeding efforts.},

  abstract = {Papaya (Carica papaya) is an economically important fruit crop that is mostly planted in tropical and subtropical regions. Major diseases of papaya, such as the papaya dieback disease (PDD), papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) disease, and papaya sticky disease (PSD), have caused large yield and economic losses in papaya-producing countries worldwide. Postharvest losses have also contributed to the decline in papaya production. Hence, there is an urgent need to secure the production of papaya for a growing world population. Integration of omics resources in crop breeding is anticipated in order to facilitate better-designed crops in the breeding programme. In papaya research, the application of omics and bioinformatics approaches are gradually increased and are underway. Hence, this review focuses on addressing omics technologies and bioinformatics that are used in papaya research. To date, four traits of the papaya have been studied using omics and bioinformatics approaches, which include its ripening process, abiotic stress, disease resistance, and fruit quality (i.e., sweetness, fruit shape, and fruit size). This review also highlights the potential of genetics and genomics data, as well as the systems biology approach that can be applied in a papaya-breeding programme in the near future.},
